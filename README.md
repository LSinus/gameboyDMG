# Gameboy DMG Emulator

This is an emulator written in C just for fun during the summer, mainly as a way to learn more about hardware emulation.

It’s not fully functional yet — it’s still missing some core components such as serial data transfer, memory bank controller decoding from the cartridge header for larger ROMs, and audio emulation. Furthermore, there are still some rendering issues in smaller games like Tetris and Alleyway.
